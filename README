Running the tester
-------------------

(1)make sure that your object inspector is in the current directory
   with the Test driver you have properly set up your CLASSPATH
   properly.

(2) in the directory you have the Test Driver and all testing
    classes in type:

    java Asst2TestDriver ( name / full path to your Object inspector)
 

(eg)  java Asst2TestDriver  ObjectInspector

You can veryify the ouput by checking back to the structure of the
test classes to make sure they are correct.
